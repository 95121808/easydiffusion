# Making images
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your browser (after completing the [installation](installation/)). It may take a few moments for the back-end to be ready.

## With a text description
1. Enter a text prompt, like `a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse` in the textbox.
2. Press `Make Image`. This will take some time, depending on your system's processing power.
3. See the image generated using your prompt.

## With an image
1. Click `Browse..` next to `Initial Image`. Select your desired image.
2. An optional text prompt can help you further describe the kind of image you want to generate.
3. Press `Make Image`. See the image generated using your prompt.

You can use Face Correction or Upscaling to improve the image further.

**Pro tip:** You can also click `Use as Input` on a generated image, to use it as the input image for your next generation. This can be useful for sequentially refining the generated image with a single click.

**Another tip:** Images with the same aspect ratio of your generated image work best. E.g. 1:1 if you're generating images sized 512x512.
