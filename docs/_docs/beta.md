The beta version includes new features that we're working on. New beta versions are announced
in our [discord community](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB). 
There might still be some bugs in the version. If you find some, please report them to `#beta`
on discord.

To join the beta program, switch to the beta chanel in the system settings:

You can return to the stable version by unchecking the checkbox.

You must restart the application to switch between the beta version and the stable version. When you
are using the beta version, the version number at the top left of the web page will include `(beta)`.
